<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<em>This section and its sub-sections are non-normative.</em>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use cases</h3>

This specification intends to address the following use cases:

*   The owner of a [=payment method=] wishes to authorize only certain parties to distribute
    [=payment apps=] that are capable of implementing the payment method. In this use case, the
    browser helps to ensure that for that payment method, the user can only invoke payment apps from
    parties authorized by the owner of the payment method.

*   In addition, the owner of a [=payment method=] wishes to confirm the authenticity of a
    particular payment app (e.g., via a digital signature for that app).

*   When the user has not yet installed a [=payment app=] for a [=payment method=], the user agent
    can provide an improved user experience for procuring a payment app.

This is accomplished via the requirement that every [=payment method=] whose
[=payment method/identifier=] is a URL will provide a manifest file in JSON format containing two
key pieces of information:

*   any default [=payment apps=], if any, that are associated with this [=payment method=],
    referenced as [=absolute-URL strings=] giving the [=web app manifest/URL=] of their
    [=web app manifests=]; and
*   any other [=origins=], if any, that are permitted to return back payment credentials for this
    [=payment method=].

<h3 id="accessing">Accessing the manifest</h3>

The resource identified by the [=payment method identifier=] URL does not directly contain the
machine-readable manifest. It is often a generic URL (such as "<code>https://alicepay.com/</code>")
which is more suitable for containing, e.g., a splash page. Instead, a HTTP Link header is used
to direct user agents seeking out the machine-readable manifest to another location. [[RFC5988]]

<div class="example" id="example-http-link">
    A user agent might issue a request to the [=payment method identifier=] URL as follows:

    <pre>
        HEAD / HTTP/2
        Host: alicepay.com
        User-Agent: Mellblomenator/9000
    </pre>

    The server would then respond:

    <pre>
        HTTP/2 204
        Link: &lt;/pay/payment-manifest.json>; rel="payment-method-manifest"
    </pre>
</div>
